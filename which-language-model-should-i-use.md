# Which Language Model Should I Use?

DeskMate's chat power are driven by multiple different large language models that have been optimized and fine-tuned. The characters are well-trained to know the smart way to speak xD. The currently available language models include ChatGLM, ChatGPT, Claude, Wenxin Yiyan, and QWen. Our devs are working hard to support more language models.

In general, the user experience with each model is similar. However, due to the data cut-off date and policies of the models themselves, different language models may produce different responses.

Language models are switchable, with the method detailed at the end of this article.

DeskMate comes with plenty of funny jokes and memes on top of large language models, integrating human-like modules such as memory, emotion, and cognition. We have established a Personality Pentagram model and formed the personality of each character based on this. In addition, we have enhanced the learning ability of the girls and boys. For information unknown to the underlying large language model or the knowledge beyond the cutoff date, characters can learn from the internet on her own. We can also order he/she to learn and organize the knowledge into a more complex structure.

P.S. All models are commercially licensed. Due to the technical nature of the models, though efforts are made at each step to ensure data compliance and accuracy, due to the probabilistic randomness of AI models, we cannot guarantee the legality, truthfulness, accuracy, or completeness of the output content. By using this service, we assume you have acknowledged all the risks and responsibilities with the output of the DeskMate.

## Introduction to Large Language Models

### ChatGLM

ChatGLM is a Chinese-English bilingual language model launched by Zhipu AI and Tsinghua University's KEG Lab, pre-trained with 14 billion language data and human preference alignment. Its base model performed on par with GPT-3 in Stanford's HELM mainstream large model evaluation in terms of accuracy and malice, with better performance in robustness and calibration error among all models. ChatGLM has undergone 3 rounds of iterations, and the model utilized by DeskMate has 6.2 billion parameters, competitive among models of the same size, possessing strong language understanding capabilities, supporting multi-round dialogues, content creation, and information summarization. The model scored an average of 45.46 on the MMLU English test (human 41.23) and 50.1 on the C-Eval (human 50.6). The model excels in Chinese and also supports English. Concentrated essence, accelerated by our engineers, our system's model can return your answer quickly.

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a large language model launched by OpenAI based on GPT-3, trained with massive high-quality and diverse data. It combines large-scale unsupervised learning with reinforcement learning based on human feedback, endowing it with profound language understanding and creative language generation capabilities. It can understand semantics, engage in multi-round dialogues, and produce coherent and consistent responses, and can refuse inappropriate requests to reduce the risk of generating harmful information. The model excels in English and also supports other languages, with training data up to September 2021. You can also train your own customized AI girlfriend in non-style mode, to discover a unique deskmate.

### Claude

Claude is a large language model developed by Anthropic (a team composed of former OpenAI researchers and engineers), skilled in deep dialogue, content creation, complex reasoning, creative work, and coding. It can perform Q&A, information retrieval, summarization, sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, and miscellaneous text classification through text communication. Claude uses an improved and optimized Transformer model, with over 50 billion parameters, capable of generating high-quality, diverse, logical, and consistent text. Easy with English, no problem with Chinese. It supports up to 100k tokens (about 75,000 words) context window, exceeding some mainstream models' 32K, allowing analysis of very long texts. If you wanna DeskMate to remember more talks or longer responses, pick Claude.

### Wenxin Yanyan

Wenxin Yiyan is a knowledge-enhanced large language model independently developed by Baidu, trained with massive high-quality data, excelling in text understanding, content creation, and dialogue Q&A, possessing the most advanced natural language processing capabilities in the Chinese domain. It can interact with people, answer questions, assist in creation, and help efficiently and conveniently obtain information, knowledge, and inspiration. Baidu's big model, well, you know, it's more based on the decades accumulated search and web-crawled data. In the SuperCLUE Chinese large model comprehensive benchmark test on October 25, 2023 (SuperCLUE is a comprehensive benchmark for general Chinese large models released by the CLUE community), Wenxin Yiyan performed outstandingly. Whoa! Writing poems for you, prey the best for you, doing the impossible for you.

### Qwen

Qwen is a large language model launched by Alibaba, performing well in text generation and understanding. It supports multi-round dialogues, paperwork writing, logical reasoning, multilingual capabilities, and has strong writing abilities, capable of continuing novels, writing emails, etc. The full name of this LLM is "Tongyi Qianwen". ""Tongyi" means the model has a broad knowledge and universality, understanding and answering questions in various fields. "Qianwen" represents the model's ability to answer various questions, meeting users' needs in different scenarios. In the C-Eval global large model comprehensive test on October 29, 2023 (C-Eval is a comprehensive test set for Chinese language models jointly constructed by Tsinghua University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and the University of Edinburgh, including 13,948 multiple-choice questions covering 52 different subjects and four difficulty levels), it ranked at the forefront among closed-source models. No more worries about DeskMate girl's exams.

## Differences Between Language Models

The specific user experience differs slightly with each large language model. Users can choose according to personal preferences. Due to the complexity of large model training, the training data may not include the most recent information.

*TL;DR*

- ChatGLM: backed by THU, bilingual in Chinese and English

- ChatGPT: OpenAI, legendary, logic and multilingual

- Claude: Incredible long talk~ Extraordinarily long, multilingual

- Wenxin Yiyan: Baidu's endorsement, bilingual in Chinese and English

- Qwen: C-Eval quiz genius, bilingual in Chinese and English
