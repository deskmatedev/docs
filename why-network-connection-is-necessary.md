# Why is an Internet Connection Required?

!> Desk Mate requires an internet connection to operate!

## AI Inference Requires Significant Computing Resources

Desk Mate requires a substantial amount of computing resources for AI inference (i.e., memory and response generation). Especially when dealing with complex models and big data, which often involve a large number of parameters and computing units, the required computing resources can grow exponentially. Consequently, local devices may not offer enough memory and processing power. Connecting to the internet allows these software applications to utilize the more robust server resources we provide, ensuring faster and more accurate inferences.

## Local Inference vs. Server-Side Inference

- **Local Inference**: The advantage is that data doesn't need to be transmitted over the network, ensuring privacy and speed. However, due to the limitations of local device memory and processing power, inference time might increase.
- **Server-Side Inference**: Takes place on powerful servers and can utilize more computing resources. The results are faster and can handle more complex tasks. However, data transmission latency and privacy concerns may arise. Data transfers for Desk Mate have been optimized by our Devs for fast transmission speeds, and data is encrypted end-to-end during transit, ensuring security and reliability.

## Data Transmission

Using the internet ensures that Desk Mate and the underlying model are always up-to-date. As new data is constantly incorporated, AI models require periodic training and updates. An internet connection ensures that users always work with the most recent and optimized model, providing a superior user experience.

## Cloud Sync and Cross-Device Collaboration

Connecting to the internet isn't just about computation. For Desk Mate, cloud synchronization is also crucial. In the future, we plan to update apps for other platforms (like iOS or Android clients) and even hardware products. Users can experience consistency across different devices and easily switch between them. Moreover, cross-device collaboration simplifies data and setting backup and restoration.
