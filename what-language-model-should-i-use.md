# Which Language Model Should I Use?

DeskMate's core linguistic ability is driven by optimized and fine-tuned large language models. The characters have undergone professional training, understanding what to say and what not to say. Currently available language models include GPT-3.5/4, ChatGLM 1/2, Baichuan, Qwen, and Wenxin Yanyan. Our devs are working hard to support more major language models.

In general, the user experience of each model is similar. However, due to the model's data cutoff date and regulations, different language models may produce different answers.

Language models are switchable, with the method detailed at the end of this article.

On top of these major language models, DeskMate has integrated a vast amount of colloquial content and interesting anecdotes. It has also incorporated memory, emotion, cognition, and other human-like modules. We have established a "big five" personality system, forming the individuality of each character. Moreover, we have enhanced the learning ability of the characters. For information unknown to the underlying large language models, DeskMate will crawl the internet to learn on its own. You can even command her not only to learn but also organize into a complete knowledge system.
