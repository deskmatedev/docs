# Do I Need to Purchase a Membership?

Whether or not to purchase a membership depends on several factors, such as your budget and affordability, satisfaction with the performance of the characters, willingness to continue supporting the project, and more.

## Why We Charge

We aim for DeskMate to be a satisfactory and excellent product. In this context, various costs are inevitable, including but not limited to labor costs, R&D costs, operational costs, and essential promotion expenses. Through a membership fee system, we can achieve a break-even point, attain better growth, optimize the product more efficiently, and develop more cool new features.

## Personal Budget and Affordability

Your personal budget is a crucial factor in deciding whether to purchase a membership. If you're a minor not yet self-sufficient, or if you believe the monthly fee takes up a significant portion of your living expenses, then buying a membership might not be a good choice. The free version is adequate for most use cases. If you feel the monthly fee won't impact your lifestyle, we'd be delighted to welcome you to join as our member or even as a premium member, experiencing the revolutionary changes the latest technology brings to life.

## DeskMate User Experience

The user experience of DeskMate is another crucial evaluation factor. The characters will, of course, do their best to win the hearts of users, but they aren't perfect. We highly appreciate your feedback on social media or user feedback channels, offering opinions or suggestions to DeskMate.

## Supporting the Project

If you believe DeskMate is an impressive software, or you hope that DeskMate can become an outstanding product in the future, we welcome your support!
