# Lite Mode

The lite mode is a minimalist-style usage mode. In this mode, Deskmate's resource usage will be minimized to its limit, and its presence will be reduced to the bare minimum.

In lite mode, most animations and effects will be turned off, 3D rendering will be optimized to 2D rendering, but voice effects and features will be retained.

## How to Enter Lite Mode

In "More Option" panel, click the "Lite Mode" switch.
