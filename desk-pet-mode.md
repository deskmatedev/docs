# DeskPet Mode

The DeskPet mode is a special mode for DeskMate. In this mode, DeskMate will leave its own space and interact with you directly on the desktop!

In DeskPet mode, the area that DeskMate occupies on the screen is small, but due to rendering mechanisms, its performance consumption is higher than in window mode.
